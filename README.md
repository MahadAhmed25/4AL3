# ðŸ¤– CS/SE 4AL3 â€” Applied Machine Learning  
### McMaster University | Prof. Charles Welch  

This repository is my personal **resource hub** for the course **Applied Machine Learning (CS/SE 4AL3)** â€” designed to centralize everything from **lecture notes** and **textbook readings** to **assignments**, **practice code**.  

It serves as both a **study companion** and a **reproducible workspace** for learning, coding, and experimenting with machine learning algorithms from scratch.
